## What?
A POSIX shell (dash) wrapper around
[lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar). It is specifically tailored for
the use with herbstluftwm, though you can easily modify it to work with the
window manager of your liking.

## Why?
First of all, lemonbar requires a wrapper around it, generating data for it
to display. It is not a panel like bmpanel that you can install and use right
away.

Why write yet another wrapper when there's tons of them available already?
Primarily because I was dissatisfied with anything I found so far. I want a
single, pure-POSIX shell script, ideally less than 100 lines. No Python, no
FIFO.

## How?
I noticed that as my needs and computers change, so do my panels. This doesn't mean that one of my newer wrappers is better than the older ones, so do check out all of them to discover whichever you like best. Simply have a look into the different branches of this repository.
